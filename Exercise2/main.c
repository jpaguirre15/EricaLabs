/*
// Programmed by: Erica Chen
// Coached by: Pete Aguirre II
// Description: For this second exercise, we will be modifying the program that
//              was taught to us from Lab 1 so that it can solve a logistic
//              population growth model. We continue learning about the
//              modeling process and how there are two approaches, which is the
//              classical and alternative approach. We also learned how to save
//              a data file, which is needed for this exercise because we are
//              solving for two sets of results. The model used for this
//              exercise for the program to solve will be:
//                Nt+1 = Nt +rNt(1- Nt/K), where:
//                - N will be population size
//                - t is time in months
//                - r is the reproductive rate
//                - which is 0.25 per year
//                - K is the carrying capacity which is 100
//              Run 1 will have an initial population of size 2, which is under
//              the carrying capacity and Run 2 will have an initial population
//              size of 120, which is over the carrying capacity. We want to see
//              the results of the population size for both tests in 100 months.
