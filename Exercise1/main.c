/*
// Programmed by: Erica Chen
// Coached by: Pete Aguirre II
// Description: For this first exercise, we got introduced to programming with
//              C, which is a computer program language that helps create a
//              list of functions for a computer to follow, such as generating
//              a simple population growth model. The model used for this
//              exercise is given in:
//                Nt+1 = Nt +rNt, where:
//                - N is the number of animals in the population
//                - t is the time in months
//                - r is the growth rate coefficient
//                -which is 0.5.
//              By programming with C on a computer, we can easily get the
//              number of offsprings in x number of months.
